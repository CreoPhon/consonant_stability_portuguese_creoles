Load libraries

    library(tidyverse)
    library(lingtypology)

Load data

    df = read.table("./consonant_stability_ptspcreoles_database - All.tsv", sep="\t", header=T, comment.char="", quote="", encoding="UTF-8")

Extract unique language names

    language <- levels(as.factor(df$Language))

Find glottocodes

    glottocodes <- gltc.lang(language)

Build a table

    glottocodes_for_creoles <- tibble(language, glottocodes)

Results: There was a mismatch between the language names in the df
(taken from APiCs) and the ones from Glottolog (which are the basis of
the Morozâ€™s package). Moreover, the code assigned to Diu creole turn out
to be incorrect. Then, I added the missing data manually.
